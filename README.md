# status-bar

Host the status bar at the bottom of the workspace and provide a tile service.

## Features

- **Tile host**: lets other packages add custom tiles to the left or right side of the bar, ordered by priority.
- **Toggle**: show or hide the whole status bar with a command.
- **Full-width**: fit the bar to the window width or to the active editor.

## Installation

To install `status-bar` search for it in the Install pane of the Lumine settings, or run the command `lumine --install lumine-code/status-bar`.

## Commands

Commands available in `lumine-workspace`:

- `status-bar:toggle`: show or hide the status bar at the bottom of the workspace.

## Usage

Packages add tiles through the `status-bar` service:

```js
const tile = statusBar.addLeftTile({ item: element, priority: 420 });
tile.destroy();
```

Always keep the returned tile and `destroy()` it on teardown. Removing only the element leaves the tile in the bar's ordered collection, and the next insertion positioned against that detached item fails.

### Tile priorities

**A lower priority sits closer to its panel's outer edge.** On the left panel that means further left; on the right panel it means further right. Tiles with equal priorities fall back to activation order, which is not stable, so every tile should carry its own number.

Priorities are grouped into bands of 100, numbered from the outer edge inwards, with a step of 10 inside each band so tiles can be inserted later without renumbering. A package that owns several adjacent tiles steps by one from its own slot instead, keeping the band's remaining tens free.

Left panel, from the left edge inwards:

| Priority | Band             | Tiles                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 110      | Diagnostics      | linter                                                           |
| 210, 220 | Repository       | git-center repository, git-center branch                         |
| 310, 320 | File identity    | editor-status path, grammar-selector (when shown on the left)    |
| 410–450  | Language tooling | jupyter-repl, latex-tools, typst-tools, tasklist-tools, prettier |
| 510, 520 | View info        | editor-status cursor position, image-editor size                 |

Right panel, from the right edge inwards:

| Priority | Band              | Tiles                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 110      | Application       | settings-view                                                           |
| 210–243  | Editor modes      | cursor-leader, column-selection, overtype-mode, invert-colors (240–243) |
| 250      | Code intelligence | ide-client servers                                                      |
| 310, 320 | Source control    | git-panel, github-panel                                                 |
| 410–430  | File identity     | grammar-selector, encoding-selector, line-ending-selector               |
| 510–530  | Observers         | latex-tools, typst-tools, prettier observed files                       |
| 610      | Activity          | busy-signal                                                             |
| 710, 720 | Warnings          | deprecation-cop, incompatible-packages                                  |

Two bands share the 200s: the editor modes take 210–243 and code intelligence 250. They are adjacent kinds — both answer "what is this window doing to my file right now" — and the language-server item belongs outside source control rather than among the observers, since it is always present.

## Customization

Restyle the status bar by adding CSS to your `styles.css`. For example, to enlarge the text and add a top border:

```css
status-bar {
  font-size: 13px;
  border-top: 1px solid fade(#000, 20%);
}
```

## Services

- [`status-bar`](docs/status-bar.md): provided to host indicator tiles at the bottom of the workspace, with a left and right side other packages can add to.
